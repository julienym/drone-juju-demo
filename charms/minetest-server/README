Minetest is a fun, free and open source voxel game inspired by Minecraft.
It supports various game modes, like survival and creative, and many more can
be added with mods.

This Charm deploys a basic game server, and is backed by a PostgreSQL database
for maximum performance. There are no mods, so you will need to add them
yourself.

To deploy:

$ juju bootstrap
$ juju deploy postgresql
$ juju deploy minetest-server
$ juju expose minetest-server
